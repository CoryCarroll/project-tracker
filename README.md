WORK DAY TRACKER

I have created an application that will allow you to set and keep reminders, events and daily tasks by the hour. When you load the page you will find the current day and time slots for regular business hours. You can type in and submit reminders, events and daily tasks for each hour. You can find your inputs saved to local storage and displayed on the planner if the page is refreshed or you leave and come back to the page.

Here is a link to the deployed site
